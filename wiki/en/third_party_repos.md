Here are the repositories from where ConsoleCP takes third-party scripts, at the moment there are three of them:

+ [Wireguard install](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install)
+ [OpenVPN install](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install)
+ [PHP ioncube installer](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rangerz/271504c282ea254779ddb730605fd662/raw/28193a7d1595939c0d10ad1822fa4b95d0e915b0)

I express my special gratitude for the repositories listed here to the authors of these repositories.
